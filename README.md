# Homework 1

## Description

I have been hired to refactor the existing code for this Horiseon page to meet accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.

I added semantic HTML elements and ensured those elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. I also added detailed alt attributes to the images.

All links functioned as intended.

For cleaner, more efficient code, I consolidated the selectors and properties of the CSS, and reorganized them to follow the logical semantic structure of the HTML elements to make it cleaner. I also included comments.
